## Project Overview

Films is a modern React 19 application designed to browse movies using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It allows users to discover popular, top-rated, and upcoming films, view detailed information, and manage a persistent personal wishlist. The project prioritizes performance, accessibility (a11y), and maintainability.

## Functional Description

The application is structured around a central browsing experience with specific user flows:

### Movie Discovery (Homepage)

<Feature icon="film" title="Organized Carousels">
  Displays movies categorized by Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="mouse-pointer-click" title="Interactive Cards">
  Navigate to a detailed view of any movie with a single click.
</Feature>

### Detailed Movie View

<Feature icon="info" title="In-Depth Information">
  Provides comprehensive details about a specific film (handled by MovieDetail page).
</Feature>

<Feature icon="heart" title="Wishlist Toggle">
  Allows users to add or remove the specific movie from their wishlist.
</Feature>

### Wishlist Management

<Feature icon="bookmark" title="Dedicated Wishlist Page">
  View all your saved movies in one place.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="refresh-ccw" title="Cross-tab Synchronization">
  If you update your wishlist in one tab, other open tabs update automatically without a refresh.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="save" title="Persistent Storage">
  Data is saved locally, so the wishlist survives browser refreshes.
</Feature>

### Navigation & UX

<Feature icon="loader" title="Lazy Loading">
  Pages are loaded on demand to speed up initial load time.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="accessibility" title="Accessibility">
  Includes "Skip to Main Content" links, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML to support screen readers and keyboard navigation.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="alert-circle" title="Error Handling">
  Custom "Not Found" pages and specific API error handling (Network Error, Rate Limited).
</Feature>

## Technical Architecture

The project uses a robust, modern stack centered around React ecosystem best practices.

### Core Stack

<Feature icon="code-2" title="Framework">
  React 19 with TypeScript for strict type safety.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="zap" title="Build Tool">
  Vite, configured for fast development and optimized production builds.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="palette" title="Styling">
  SCSS (Sass) using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for modular and maintainable styles.
</Feature>

### State Management & Data Fetching

<Feature icon="cloud" title="Server State (API Data)">
  TanStack Query (React Query v5) handles caching (5-minute stale time), automatic retries, and loading/error states. Abstracts data fetching logic into custom hooks like `useMovies` and `useMovieDetails`.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="database" title="Client State (Wishlist)">
  Zustand is used for global state management with persist middleware to save the wishlist to localStorage. Custom logic handles storage events to sync state across browser tabs.
</Feature>

### Routing & Navigation

<Feature icon="route" title="React Router DOM">
  React Router DOM (v7) with React.lazy and Suspense to code-split route components, reducing the initial bundle size.
</Feature>

### API Layer

<Feature icon="server" title="Service Pattern">
  All API calls are encapsulated in a TMDBService class. Native fetch API is used with a custom wrapper that handles authentication and normalizes HTTP errors.
</Feature>

### Testing Strategy

<Feature icon="check-square" title="Unit Testing">
  Jest with React Testing Library for component and utility logic.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="test-tube" title="Functional/Integration Testing">
  Vitest for running functional tests and end-to-end flows.
</Feature>

### Key Dependencies

React, TypeScript, Vite, Sass, Zustand, @tanstack/react-query, react-router-dom, Vitest, Jest.
