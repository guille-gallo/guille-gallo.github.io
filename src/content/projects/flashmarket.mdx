</Feature>

<Feature icon="type" title="Language">
  TypeScript for type-safe development.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="zap" title="Build Tool">
  Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="database" title="State Management">

### Architecture & Implementation Details

#### Data Layer

<Feature icon="rss" title="WebSocket Service">
  A dedicated composable `useCryptoWebSocket` connects to `wss://stream.binance.com:9443`. It subscribes to multi-stream channels for both @ticker (24h stats) and @trade (live execution) events.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="cpu" title="State Optimization">
  Uses `shallowRef` and Map structures in Pinia instead of deep reactivity arrays/objects. This crucial optimization handles the high-throughput frequency of crypto market updates without freezing the UI.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="trash" title="Data Pruning">
  To prevent memory leaks, trade history keeps only the last minute or a maximum of 500 trades per symbol, with periodic interval pruning of old data.
</Feature>

#### UI Components

<Feature icon="layout-dashboard" title="DashboardPage.vue">
  The main orchestrator that manages the WebSocket connection lifecycle and passes data to child components.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="trending-up" title="PriceChart.vue">
  Wraps the lightweight-charts library. Uses `markRaw` to exclude the chart instance from Vue's reactivity system (performance optimization) and aggregates high-frequency trade data into 1-second candles to smooth out rendering.
</Feature>

<Feature icon="server" title="BinanceService">
  Handles the protocol logic, parsing raw WebSocket messages into typed `TickerData` and `TradeData` interfaces.
</Feature>
